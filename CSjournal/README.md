To launch and enter the CS journal website, first download the CSjournal.zip.

Now you can do one of 2 things:

1. unzip the file using a file opener on your computer before uploading the unzipped folder to your codespace. Delete the zip file from your computer.
2. upload the zip file to your codespace and then execute "unzip CSjournal.zip" in your terminal. Then type "rm CSjournal.zip" in the terminal to delete the CSjournal zip file from your directory.

Now type "cd" in your terminal to return to the main directory.

Then, type "cd CSjournal" into your terminal to enter the directory where the website is located.

Type "flask run" in the terminal to start up the Flask web-server (which CSjournal is hosted on).

A link to the website will be in the terminal. Click the link and you will arrive at the CS Journal login page. If you don't have an account, make sure to register first to access the rest of the website! Once you are in the website, the navigation bar at the top will take you around the website.

If you want to stop the web server and return to the terminal, press "Ctrl + C". 

The Journals page will allow you to write new journal entries and also view all previously written entries. Pressing the "Write" button will allow you to input a title and journal entry, the date is automatically set to the current date. Make sure to fill out both the Title and Journal Entry fields. The "View Entry" Button will reveal all the details of the journal including the entry text which is not displayed in the Journals table.

The Goals page allows you to set CS goals for yourself. You can add new goals, edit existing ones (as well as mark them complete) and finally delete goals. Type a goal into the text field and press "Add Goal" to add a new goal to your list. Click "Edit" and a textbox will pop up below with a box to edit your goal. Checking "Goal Completed" will add the date of completion to the Goals table.

The Inspiration page is meant to encourage you when you are feeling down about your progress and inspire you to keep going. The page has a button called "Cheer me Up!" that when clicked, will generate cute cat pictures to cheer you up. At the bottom, there is also a friendly AI chatbot that will encourage you with motivational quotes!
